                    BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: B angtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.

                    BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.[11] BTS was originally supposed to be a hip hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM,[12] but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided instead to create an idol group similar to Seo Taiji and Boys who were popular in the 90's. A group able to make socially conscious music without the restrictions K-pop bands were known for, able to be sincere and genuine at a time where K-pop bands were highly regimented.[13] Originally slated to debut in 2011, the group featured on several tracks by artists like 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed. They were later reorganized into a more traditional idol group.[14] Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud
